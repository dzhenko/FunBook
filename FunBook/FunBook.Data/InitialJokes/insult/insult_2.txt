A teacher wanted to teach her students about self-esteem, so she asked anyone who thought they were stupid to stand up. One kid stood up and the teacher was surprised. She didnâ€™t think anyone would stand up so she asked him, â€œWhy did you stand up?â€ He answered, â€œI didnâ€™t want to leave you standing up by yourself.â€
