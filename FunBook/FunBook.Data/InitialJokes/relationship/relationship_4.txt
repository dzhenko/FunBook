After Brian proposed to Jill, his father took him to one side. â€œSon, when I first got married to your mother, the first thing I did when we got home was take off my pants. I gave them to your mother and told her to try them on, which she did. They were huge on her and she said that she couldnâ€™t wear them because they were too large. I said to her, 'Of course they are too big for you, I wear the pants in this family and I always will.' Ever since that day, son, we have never had a single problem." Brian took his dadâ€™s advice and did the same thing to his wife on his wedding night. Then, Jill took off her panties and gave them to Brian. â€œTry these on,â€ she said. Brian went along with it and tried them on, but they were far too small. â€œWhatâ€™s the point of this? I canâ€™t get into your panties,â€ said Brian. â€œExactly,â€ Jill replied, â€œand if you donâ€™t change your attitude, you never will!â€
