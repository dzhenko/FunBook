A family is at the dinner table. The son asks the father, â€œDad, how many kinds of boobs are there?â€ The father, surprised, answers, â€œWell, son, a woman goes through three phases. In her 20s, a womanâ€™s breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her 30s and 40s, they are like pears, still nice, hanging a bit. After 50, they are like onions.â€ â€œOnions?â€ the son asks. â€œYes. You see them and they make you cry.â€ This infuriated his wife and daughter. The daughter asks, â€œMom, how many different kinds of willies are there?â€ The mother smiles and says, â€œWell, dear, a man goes through three phases also. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his 30s and 40s, itâ€™s like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his 50s, itâ€™s like a Christmas tree.â€ â€œA Christmas tree?â€ the daughter asks. â€œYes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.â€
