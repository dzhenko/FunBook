A mother is in the kitchen making dinner for her family when her daughter walks in.

â€œMother, where do babies come from?â€

The mother thinks for a few seconds and says, â€œWell dear, Mommy and Daddy fall in love and get married. One night they go into their bedroom, they kiss and hug, and have sex.â€

The daughter looks puzzled so the mother continues, â€œThat means the daddy puts his penis in the mommyâ€™s vagina. Thatâ€™s how you get a baby, honey.â€ The child seems to comprehend.

â€œOh, I see, but the other night when I came into your room you had daddyâ€™s penis in your mouth. What do you get when you do that?â€

â€œJewelry, my dear. Jewelry.â€
