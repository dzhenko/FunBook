A young woman was taking golf lessons and had just started playing her first round of golf when she suffered a bee sting. Her pain was so intense that she decided to return to the clubhouse for medical assistance.

The golf pro saw her heading back and said, â€œYou are back early, whatâ€™s wrong?â€ â€œI was stung by a bee!â€ she said. â€œWhere?â€ he asked. â€œBetween the first and second hole.â€ she replied. He nodded and said, â€œYour stance is far too wide.â€
